### Hi there! 👋 Coding for life here! 💻
😄 Pronouns: He/him

🔭 I’m currently working on cool things at Federal Reserve Bank that I can't share at GitHub. Check my website @ [https://johnroach.io](https://johnroach.io) for some articles I wrote on different tech and life

💬 Ask me about Ansible, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, GCP and AWS stuff. If I don't know answer can show direction. Expect "Did you Google this?" for certain questions
